### Event Driven

the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (clicks, keypresses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs. It is widely used in GUI-based applications.

### Dynamic typing

the type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than being explicitly declared. Python does not require you to specify the data type of a variable when defining it.
