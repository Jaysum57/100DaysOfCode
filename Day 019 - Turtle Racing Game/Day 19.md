# Day 19: Instances, State and Higher Order Functions

## Notes

**Event listeners** -  a way for us to listen for key strokes

### instance of a class

```python
from turtle import Turtle

tim = Turtle()
tommy = Turtle()
```

both `tim` and `tommy` are **instances** of the class Turtle()

### State

```python
tim.color = green

tommy.color = purple
```

the state of tim's color is "green" while,
the state of tommy's color is "purple."
