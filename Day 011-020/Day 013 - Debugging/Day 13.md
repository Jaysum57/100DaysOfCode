# Day 13: Debugging How to find and fix errors in your code

## Notes

## How to fix a bug?

1. Describe the problem - try to make sense of what is going on.
2. Reproduce the Bug - when you encounter it once but you don't encounter it the next time that becomes a really difficult bug to fix.
3. Play computer - pretend to be a computer
4. Fix the Errors - before you continue
5. Print is Your Friend - use print()
6. Use a debugger

* **Breakpoint** - line in your code where you want to stop the program and see step by step on what the code is doing.

## Debugging Tips

* Take a break
* Ask a friend
* Run often - run your code often
* Ask stackoverflow

## Personal Notes

1. Don't immediately ask user for input. Have a hypothetical input so that it would be easier to debug
